Back in March 2005 I applied to a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) Developer position in a company that was looking for a developer with “**entrepreneurial spirit**.”

I was _intrigued_ by that requirement.

I interviewed, passed the technical test, and started working for my first startup in April 2005. That’s when I caught the _entrepreneurial bug_.

It wasn’t until March 2008 that I started working full-time for the first company I co-founded.

Ever since I started that [first company](http://www.aycron.com) I haven’t stopped building businesses. One thing I learned in this first experience is that just because you know how to build software it doesn’t mean that you know how to run a software business.

In March 2011 I started my [second and current company](https://www.ombulabs.com). With time I have learned many things about running a business, but I still feel like I have so much more to learn and improve.

I have been running businesses for **more than 8 years**. Today I like to look back and appreciate all the things that I’ve built. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions.

After all these years, I’ve learned that the most important thing about running a business is forming a **team** that you can count on. Being able to delegate is both challenging and rewarding. I’m glad to say I’m getting better at this.

If you have this **entrepreneurial spirit** (or entrepreneurial bug) you know that you will **always** have it. You will always have the **initiative** to _make things better_.
