Sure, **experience** is very important, but not as much as **passion**.

Hire people who **love the craft.**

Hire people who work on their craft even when nobody is paying them.

Hire people who **really love what they do**.

10 years of experience is not as important as real passion for what you do.

Hiring based on experience is **easy**. You look at the resume and you decide. It’s a poor decision.

Hiring based on passion is **hard**. How can you tell if the candidate is truly passionate about their job?

Judge candidates based on what they do on weekends and outside of the office. That is even more important than their accomplishments in their resume.

When things are hard only **passionate people** will **deliver more than expected**.

When you’re hiring look for **true passion.**
