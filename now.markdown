I'm currently working on scaling [FastRuby.io](https://fastruby.io) and [OmbuLabs](https://ombulabs.com). I'm still trying to get better at delegating roles and responsibilities.

My last hires were a Senior Engineering Manager, a Biz Dev Coordinator, and a Marketing Coordinator. Scaling is tough, but so much fun!

I'm also excited to speak at RailsConf once again. I'll be presenting a
[workshop on Rails upgrades with my co-workers](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-1288)!

If you are looking for your next gig as a [Ruby on Rails Engineer](https://www.ombulabs.com/jobs/software-engineer?utm_source=etagwerker.com) or
[React.js Engineer](https://www.ombulabs.com/jobs/react-software-engineer?utm_source=etagwerker.com), feel free to DM me on Twitter.
