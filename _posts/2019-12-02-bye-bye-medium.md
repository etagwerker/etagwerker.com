This year Medium decided to [implement a paywall](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/medium-twitter-paywall/)
with all their content (meaning my content, and your content, and anyone's content
published in their platform)

When that happened I thought it was a good idea to leave their platform and use
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) instead. It took me almost 10 months to finally
move away from Medium! This Thanksgiving break was a good time to spend a few
hours migrating my content to Jekyll + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Here is how I did it:

<!--more-->

1. I started with [FastRuby.io](https://fastruby.io)'s blog's source code (which is
[open source](https://github.com/fastruby/blog)). Then I followed the instructions
in this article: [https://hackernoon.com/medium-2-md-convert-medium-posts-to-markdown-with-front-matter-c044e02c3cbb](https://hackernoon.com/medium-2-md-convert-medium-posts-to-markdown-with-front-matter-c044e02c3cbb)

2. I tweaked some of the content and file names. I had to massively edit file
names so that Jekyll could figure out that it had to generate HTML pages for
them.

3. I migrated from Jekyll 3.0 to 4.0. Fortunately the migration was quite easy!
You can see all the changes over here: [https://github.com/etagwerker/etagwerker.com/pull/1/files](https://github.com/etagwerker/etagwerker.com/pull/1/files)

4. I implemented [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and tweaked a few details
to find a look & feel that I liked.

5. I configured [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [GitHub](https://github.com)
to [serve the domain without `www`](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). The nice thing
about GitHub Pages is that it is simple, easy, and free for open source projects.

Here is the end result!

If you are thinking about migrating away from Medium, Jekyll is a great
alternative to have full control of your platform and content! ‚ù§Ô∏è
