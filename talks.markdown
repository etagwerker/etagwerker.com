I like to speak about things that I'm passionate about:

- Open Source
- Code Quality
- Ruby & Ruby on Rails

I guess I'm an _international speaker_ because I've spoken at many conferences
in different countries (Argentina; Uruguay; Chile; and USA)

## RubyConf Argentina 2012: The Lean Startup Hacker

In this talk I explain a few concepts about Lean Startup as applied in my first
startup: [Ombu Shop, Tu Tienda Online](https://www.ombushop.com). This talk was
in Spanish.
