I’m tired of saying that [your MVP is not small enough](https://medium.com/@etagwerker/your-mvp-is-not-small-enough-c64759a88554#.tl91gc9bf). Here are five simple rules to build a **software MVP**.

#### Rule #1

**Quality** is **non-negotiable**. Quality **must** remain high. You cannot build something that has _poor_ quality.

You are **not** building a **cheap product fast**. You are building a **quality product** with _reduced_ scope.

#### Rule #2

The **release date** is **non-negotiable**. Once you define **the scope** and set the date, you _cannot_ postpone the release date.

There is a **fixed amount of time** that you have to work on the design and development of the software MVP. Once you have defined the release date, **you cannot change it**.

#### Rule #3

The end result has to be a **usable product** which _tests_ a **core hypothesis** of your business model.

When you define the minimum feature set, you need to **always keep this in mind**:

This is a great illustration by [Henrik Kniberg](https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg). You can read more about this in his article about an [_Earliest/Testable/Lovable Product_](http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp)

#### Rule #4

You can **remove features** from the scope. You **must not** add features to the scope. The goal is to avoid [_scope creep_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) as much as possible.

Before you begin, you will have a list of **prioritized** features. You will start working on the most important features and leave the least important ones for last.

You might need to cut some of the features out of the project. So it’s best if the least important features get cut.

#### Rule #5

Before you release the **MVP** you must setup a _goal tracking mechanism_. The goal is to track the interactions with the MVP and **start learning** from day 1.

Fortunately there are great free tools that you can use like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) or [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/). If you have a small budget, you could also use [Intercom](http://intercom.io) to talk to the people using your product.

If you follow these rules, you will be able to release early and start iterating using real feedback.
