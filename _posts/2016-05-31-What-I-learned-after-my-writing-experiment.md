I’ve been writing every weekday for **more than a month**. This was a small and intense **experiment**.

To be honest, I feel like I’ve been producing a **large** **quantity** of content with **little quality.**

I’m not a big fan of this. I’ve always preferred to release _a few quality products vs. a large quantity of mediocre products._

From now on I’ll bring it down to **two** posts per week. Hopefully this will give me more time to work on my drafts and create better content.

I now have a better idea of what people want to read. If you’re a data junkie like me, here you can see the stats around my most popular article since I started writing here:

I love the simplicity of the Medium stats interface.
