Thank you for sharing this short-sighted change!

It’s as if they didn’t know how shitty the AFIP website is. Every time you need to do something with it, you either need to talk to an accountant or go to the nearest AFIP office to get help from them. It’s another UX nightmare.

Unfortunately this is a step backwards. It makes the process so much more complicated.

IMO, the systems in Argentina will continue to be a mess until they appoint a CTO for the country (a position that exists in the USA but not in Argentina).
