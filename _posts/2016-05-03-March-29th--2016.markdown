My daughter Lucila was born **a day early**. We were expecting her on March 30th.

On March 29th, I had decided to go to _work as usual_. My wife had a scheduled C-section for March 30th at 7am, so I figured that everything would go as planned.

_It didn't._

I got to work, had my coffee and wrote the first draft for this article: [The Landing Page MVP](https://www.ombulabs.ai/blog/lean-startup/mvp/the-landing-page-mvp.html).

After that I had a meeting with one of my teammates and then we had our first **#OmbuLunch**. It was the first time that we were doing a team lunch. It was great!

We rushed back to the office to have a scrum call with one of our clients. Ten minutes after we wrapped up the scrum **my wife called**.

She was in pain and had called the **midwife** to see what we should do.

I decided to go home **right away**, got in the car and in 10 minutes I was home with Claire.

Right after I walk in the door, **the phone rang**. It was the midwife.

— “How _fast_ can you get to the hospital?”

— “I can be there in **30** minutes.”

— “OK, I'll meet you there at 4pm. **We are going to do the C-section today**.”

— “OK. Sure, no problem.”

No problem? **Holy shit!** I was freaking out inside. It was time. **It was time.**

I tried to stay calm and asked my wife to get the bag. We got ready and left right away.

We got to the hospital at 3:50pm and waited for the midwife to get there. At this point my wife was still in pain, so I asked the staff to get a doctor to check on her.

Fortunately everything was **fine**.

At 4pm we put on the scrubs. Time was moving _so fast_. She was supposed to have the C-section on March 30th!

Around 4:30pm my wife got to the operating room. I was there right next to her. A few minutes after that they asked me to leave the room, the anesthesiologist had to setup the epidural.

At this point I just had to wait for them to get everything ready. Once I was allowed back in the room, Claire was almost ready for the C-section.

In my mind, the operation took _less than 5 minutes_.

My daughter was born at 5:28pm. She weighed 2.978kg and was 50 centimeters long.

I listened to my baby cry for the first time and I was **relieved**. I don't remember what I was expecting, but I remember being **so incredibly happy** to see her (even though she was purple!)

It's impossible to describe in words the joy that you feel when you become a parent.

After they ran some tests and cleaned her up, I got to finally hold her in my arms. Those minutes were **wonderful**.

She was so peaceful and I was just another fool in love.
