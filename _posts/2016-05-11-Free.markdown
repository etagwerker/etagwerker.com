Every time I need to decide between a **free** and a **paid** service I think about it long and hard.

Why is this free? How does this company make money? Is it _open source_?

If I don't understand why they are offering a service for **free**, I will usually go with the **paid** option.

Here are some of the free applications that I've used:

*   [Gmail](http://gmail.com): This service is **free** because Google uses it as another channel to place **ads**. They don't read your emails, but they have algorithms that will _automagically_ display **ads** based on the context of the page. **Genius!**
*   [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com/): This service _was_ **free** because Google offered a **free** tier and a **paid** tier. The features in the free tier would drive you to the paid tier. This service is **now paid** per seat (user in your account).
*   [Mailbox](https://www.mailboxapp.com/): I have no idea **why** this app **was free**, but it stopped working soon after [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) bought them. This is a clear example that you **cannot trust free services** to be around forever.
*   [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/): It's small business accounting software **for free**! It took me a while to believe it, but it's **free** because they will deliver partner offers within their app and that's how they make money.

I don't usually go for the **free** option right away. I recently bought [Airmail 2](http://airmailapp.com/) to handle my email accounts, even though there were some [decent free options out there](https://medium.com/@etagwerker/inbox-zero-6d22789ad20e#.ny9fia82b).

When you go with the free alternative, you need to **be careful**. You are accepting their _terms and conditions_, which probably say that they can do whatever they want with your account.
