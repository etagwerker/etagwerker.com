Ever since I started building my own company I have never been able to maintain my **inbox at zero** unread messages for more than a week.

I know that it’s possible, but I just haven’t figured it out yet. It takes **discipline**, an extensive set of [Gmail](https://gmail.com/) **filters** and an **awesome** email application.

Another thing that really helps is **delegating** some of your tasks to more capable people. You can **mark some email messages as read** because you know that someone else will take care of it.

I was happy with my Mac’s Mail application until I discovered that it sucked at storage. I use three email accounts and Mail decided to store more than **20GB** in my tiny Macbook Air!

I was happy with my iPhone’s Mail application until I discovered Mailbox.

I was happy with Mailbox until [Dropbox decided to kill it](https://www.mailboxapp.com/).

I was happy with [Polymail](https://polymail.io/) until it started sending duplicate email messages from my account, I reported the bug and never heard back from them.

I’m now happy with [Outlook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8) (the **only** Microsoft app in my life) for iOS and [Airmail 2](http://airmailapp.com/) (it’s paid but it’s worth it!) for Mac OS.

To be honest, I still use **Gmail web** every now and then, but I try to avoid it as much as possible.

I have noticed that I really need the **gestures** feature in order to handle email messages as quickly as possible. If an application doesn’t have it, I won’t use it.

Even with that, I have not managed to keep my **inbox zero** for more than a week.

It’s fine. I’ve learned to live with this. I don’t really _need_ inbox zero.

These days I’m happy to keep my inbox under **100**.
