There is a good reason [why we no longer work on fixed bid projects](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/software-development/time-and-material.html?utm_source=medium) at [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com?utm_source=medium), it's **impossible to estimate** **with** **certainty** in a **startup environment**.

#### Uncertainty

**Entrepreneurs** want to build something that has _never been built before_. How can you _estimate_ something like that?

Only if you have built something _similar_, you can estimate with **some certainty**. Even then, you will be off by _2x, 3x, 5x or more!_

At work, sometimes we help **entrepreneurs** _fix bugs_ or _add features_ to their existing projects. That doesn't make our estimates any better because their existing projects are _new to us_. We are not familiar with the code.

**We don't know** **what we will find** once we see the code. It's a known fact that **there will be a learning curve**. Unfortunately, the time spent _ascending the curve_ will directly depend on the **quality** of the code.

When you are about to take over a project, usually you don't have enough time to **analyze the code** and use that analysis as a multiplier of the **complexity** of the project that you're getting into.

Lately we have been performing _free code quality reports_ for our potential clients. This helps, but it just improves our guesses.

All of these problems cause **uncertainty**, which will mess up your **estimates**.

#### Fear

On the other hand, you are afraid that:

*   You will **overestimate** and the client won't want to work with you because there is _someone_ who will do it in _half_ the time (or so _they claim_)
*   You will **underestimate.** You will work late nights, you will _lose money_, and the client won't be happy.

Depending on how badly you want this client, you will go for one or the other.

If you **overestimate**, you will definitely follow [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law). If you **underestimate**, you will **sleep less**. It's your choice. In rare cases you will get the estimates right.

â€”

**Entrepreneurs** will usually want to know how much it will take to build _feature x._ You will only be able to **estimate accurately** once you have experience with the programming language, framework, code base, domain, feature, interfaces and expectations.

Until then **your estimates will be way off**.

In order to come up with the **best estimates**, you should always determine the [work breakdown structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) of _feature x_ and **estimate piece by piece**_._ The smaller the piece the better.

Your estimates should include a **best case** and **worst case** scenario:

*   **Worst case scenario**: The code base that you're taking over is a total mess. [Spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code), no code coverage, hard to understand, which makes it all extremely complex.
*   **Best case scenario**: The code base is clean, simple, well designed and it has decent test coverage and documentation, which makes it easy to take over.

Personally, I don't like to work with estimates. Every time I work on something, I want to finish it **as soon as possible**, keeping **quality high**, writing an **elegant solution**, being **as pragmatic as possible**.

Hopefully, your clients won't [take your estimates as a promise, they will take it as your best guess](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2136-its-not-a-promise-its-a-guess).
