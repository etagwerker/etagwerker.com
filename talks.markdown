I like to speak about things that I'm passionate about:

- Open Source
- Code Quality
- Ruby & Ruby on Rails

I've spoken at a few conferences in different countries (Argentina; Uruguay;
Chile; and USA) in both Spanish and English.

## Escaping The Tar Pit (SolidusConf, 2019)

In this talk I explain how to avoid getting stuck in the tar pit and, if you
are in it, how to gradually get out of it. This is the first time I spoke about
a new library to judge maintainability based on code quality and code coverage:

## Introducci√≥n a Lean Startup (RobinTech, 2014)

In this talk I explain a few concepts about Lean Startup after a couple of years
running my startup ([Ombu Shop](https://www.ombushop.com)). This talk was in
Spanish.

## Don't Feed The Zombies! (RubyConf Uruguay, 2013)

In this talk I explain a few good ways to inherit and maintain "zombie projects".
When you inherit a legacy project, how can you improve the status quo of the
project? How can you gradually pay off tech debt to turn a zombie into an
easy-to-maintain project?

## The Lean Startup Hacker (RubyConf Argentina, 2012)

In this talk I explain a few concepts about Lean Startup as applied in my first
startup: [Ombu Shop, Tu Tienda Online](https://www.ombushop.com). This talk was
in Spanish.
