I recently took two weeks off to spend some time with my wife after [the birth of our baby girl Lucila](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDl6insN1CS/?taken-by=etagwerker).

These two weeks were very busy, but I still had time to take a step back and think about my business and my career.

I came to the conclusion that if there is one thing that I'm missing in my day to day at work is **Consistency**.

<!--more-->

Being a Founder and Managing Director at [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com) keeps me busy every week, but I have learned to delegate responsibilities in my employees and partners.

I still _juggle 6 balls in one hand_ every week, but I need to focus more on what's important and less on what's urgent.

I've decided to be more consistent at [writing personal](https://medium.com/@etagwerker) and [professional articles](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/authors/etagwerker). From now on I'll make a serious effort to write and publish **one article per business day**.

It sounds quite hard to achieve but I believe that it will be a great exercise to improve my **consistency**.

Wish me luck!
