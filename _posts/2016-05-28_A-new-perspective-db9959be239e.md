Becoming a father for the first time sure puts things in a **different** **perspective**.

You are now responsible for another human being. This is now your **most important priority.** You need to make sure that they are healthy, well fed and constantly growing.

There are a few metrics that become the **most important metrics** in their life: _Weight_ and _Size_.

Everything else is on a different level. Within that lower level, things are important, but not as much as your newborn daughter.
