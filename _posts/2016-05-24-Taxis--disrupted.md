Taxis have been doing the same thing for years. Pick up a passenger, hear the destination, take the passenger there, get paid. It’s pretty simple and it hasn’t evolved much in decades.

Taxis in Buenos Aires are transit’s public enemy number 1

Last month [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) launched in Argentina and disrupted the whole business. [Taxis were obviously against the whole thing](http://www.businessinsider.com/argentina-crackdown-on-uber-2016-4).

In the long run, Uber and other services like [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) will become your preferred alternative. You will only hail a cab on the street when you can’t get an Uber or a Lyft.

Why?

Because the whole experience is more enjoyable and usually more secure. You can pay with your credit card. You have a clear idea of the fare. And if a driver misbehaves, you can easily report him.

Taxis never **had to** provide a **better experience** because there was no real competition. Until Uber launched in Buenos Aires, you could only get a taxi or a remise (private car service) to quickly drive you to places.

> Just because you don’t **need to** innovate, it doesn’t mean **you shouldn’t**.

That’s the beauty of **competition**. It forces the players in the game to become better players, which is great for customers.

Hopefully the city government and Uber will find a way to legalize this business model and we will have better alternatives to get from point A to point B.

Taxis will have to **adapt or die**. It’s called [survival of the fittest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest). When this finally happens, passengers will only **benefit from this disruption**.
