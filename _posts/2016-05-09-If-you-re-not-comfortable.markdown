When you are trying to hammer a nail, you need to be in a **comfortable** position. Try hammering a nail in an **uncomfortable** position, the nail will end up in a shitty position. You will take longer than if you were in a decent position.

Now try to hack some code in a loud environment with an unreliable Internet connection surrounded by people who keep interrupting you. You will likely write **poor code** in more time than usual.

Now try working in an environment where your boss is an **asshole** and you work long hours. Waking up early in the morning will be harder than if you were in a nice environment, with a boss that you respect and who respects you.

Don't **expect** your environment to **change**. Don't count on it.

If you want change **make it happen**. **Change** your environment or look for a **new** environment.
