Close your Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Skype, Mail, and anything else that might produce an interruption.

Put your phone on _do not disturb_ mode. Put your computer on [do not disturb mode](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18740?locale=en_US).

If you can work _without Internet_, shut down your connection. If you don’t need it, it will just produce interruptions.

Put on your headphones. Even if you don’t want to listen to music, you can use them to show other people that you can’t hear them.

Only then can **really focus**.

Only then you can **achieve flow**.
