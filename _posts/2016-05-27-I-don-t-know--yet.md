Some people will say “I don’t know” and expect you to tell them the answer. If you tell them the answer right away, they will probably keep asking you similar questions.

Next time you are in this situation try to guide the person to the best solution. Explore the different alternatives and mention the pros and cons of the different solutions. Let them make decisions, let them make mistakes.

If you are stuck with a problem and you don’t know how to move on, remember:

> It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get permission.

Before asking for help, do some research. Find a solution, even if you think you will get in trouble, even if you know it’s not the best solution.

Make mistakes. Break things. It is the only way to learn and gain experience.

Don’t expect someone else to provide a solution on a silver platter. You will learn so much more on your own.
