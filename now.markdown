I'm currently on vacation in Spain visiting family and friends! 

When I get back to work I plan to continue scaling [FastRuby.io](https://fastruby.io) and [OmbuLabs](https://ombulabs.com). We recently launched a new audit service for your Ruby applications, it's called [Tune Report](https://www.fastruby.io/tune)! We partnered with my friend [Nate](https://twitter.com/nateberkopec) to help companies scale their Ruby applications.
