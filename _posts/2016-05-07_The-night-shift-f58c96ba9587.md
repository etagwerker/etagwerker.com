As entrepreneurs we want to dedicate **as much time as possible** to our business. That means that we end up working **late nights**, pulling all-nighters and working on weekends.

The night shift is special. There are no meetings, no calls, no distractions. Basically, **no interruptions**. Just you and your endless _TODO_ list.

The night shift is a good resource for a short period of time. And only for a **short period of time**.

If you keep doing it for an extended period of time, it will **burn you out**.

You need the night to rest, to recover from a intense day, so that you can go back to work the next day with the same intensity.

Whatâ€™s most important, **you need limitations**. If you only have 8 hours per day, you will be forced to prioritize the items in your TODO list. Limitations drive creativity.
