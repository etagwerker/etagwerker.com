If you have an idea and you want to build an MVP, you should be able to build
it in less than a month.

In the simplest case, you will build a landing page to show your unique value
proposition and you will collect email addresses of people who might be
interested.

I wrote a detailed post about this idea for the Ombu Labs blog. Check it out! [https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/lean-startup/mvp/the-landing-page-mvp.html](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/lean-startup/mvp/the-landing-page-mvp.html)
