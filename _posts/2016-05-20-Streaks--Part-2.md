Today I broke one of my latest **streaks**. Today I **didn’t** [contribute to any **open source** projects](https://github.com/etagwerker) and I broke a **35** days straight streak.

It was a _bit_ disappointing but it was also a great run. I made at least one (sometimes very small) contribution every day for the past **35 days!**

To be honest, this happened because I decided to stop bringing my MacBook home. And I have **no regrets**. I’m much happier having less distractions at home.

Every time I break a streak, I like to think about this:

*   **How far will I go next time?** I’m quite a competitive person and I can’t help to think about the next streak. Now the mark is quite high: 35 days! It’s a new goal for the next time. Get to 36 days, beat the last streak!
*   **I can’t believe I made it so far.** I was sure I was going to quit after 10 days (when I beat my last streak) but I kept going. I kept thinking: **_How far will I go this time?_**
*   **The end of a streak brings the beginning of a new streak.**
