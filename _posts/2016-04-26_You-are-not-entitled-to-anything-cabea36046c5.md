Just because _you are you_ it doesn’t mean that you are entitled to something. This is the truth, especially if you are starting a new business.

Just because **you** released a product, it doesn’t mean that **people** are going to use it.

Just because **you** published an article, it doesn’t mean that **readers** are going to read it, like it, and share it.

These days I grow tired of people complaining about the things that _they think they deserve_.

Next time you think you deserve something ask yourself this question:

> What have you done to deserve that thing?

What have you done to deserve the attention of your audience?

What product have you delivered that is better than a similar product? Why is it better? Have you communicated it properly?

What have you delivered to deserve a raise? Have you accomplished even more than expected? Have you overdelivered?

Staying motivated is all about avoiding frustrations. You need to manage your expectations.

If you think that **you are not entitled to anything**, you will work harder to achieve your goals.

You will stop blaming others for your own shortcomings.
