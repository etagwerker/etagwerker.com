I believe that **high achieving individuals** have suffered this syndrome at least once in their life.

I first heard of this concept in the last Rubyconf Argentina. It was one of the [most interesting talks for programmers](https://vimeo.com/album/3187831/video/115000870) that had nothing to do with code.

> People who suffer this are high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed **as a fraud.**

You can read more about this [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).

What has been really helpful to me is to always ask myself this question: What’s the worst thing that can happen?

If I send a proposal to a conference, what’s the worst thing that can happen? It might get rejected.

If I present a talk at a meetup, what’s the worst thing that can happen? People might hate it and might make fun of me.

**Don’t let the fear stop you.**

Instead of thinking, **_why me_**? Think, **_why_** **_not me_**?
