**Work/life balance** is one of the most important things in your life.

Here is a piece of advice: **Work to live**. Don't live to work.

<!--more-->

Enjoy the small things in life. Take a moment to appreciate what you have accomplished so far.

Pat yourself on the back and take a moment to enjoy your accomplishments.

Here is my list of priorities:

1.  **Health:** without this I can't enjoy the rest. These days I need to focus more on my sleep. **Sleep deprivation** sucks so much!
2.  **Family:** I love my **wife** and little **daughter**! The good moments fill me with **joy** and motivate me to be better with the other items in this list.
3.  **Work:** [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com) allows me to live a comfortable life while building unique products and a company I can be proud of.
4.  **Friends:** I wish I could say this is number 3, but to be honest I have little time to hang out with friends lately. Hopefully in the future this will change.

Sometimes weeks will go by and my priorities will get all messed up. This happens when you're running a company and _wearing way too many hats_ at once.

Next time this happens, I can come back to this post to remind myself what's most important in my life.
