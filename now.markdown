I'm currently working on sales; business development; marketing; open source; and
leadership at [FastRuby.io](https://fastruby.io) and [Ombu Labs](https://ombulabs.com).
Yes, I know, I'm wearing a lot of hats in my business.

Related to that, I'm trying to get better at delegating roles and responsibilities.
My last hire was a Senior Agile Project Manager, which has been a life-changing
experience.

I'm also trying to speak at more conferences and to participate in more podcasts.
2019 was a great year in that sense, I was honored to speak at a couple of
great conferences:

- RubyConf
- SolidusConf
- Southeast Ruby
- RailsConf
