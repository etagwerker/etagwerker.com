I am hooked. Recently my commute has become a great opportunity to listen to my favorite podcasts.

I wonder if we would have [Twitter](http://twitter.com) today if Odeo had started after [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one). Probably not!

Podcasts have been around for ages, but only in the recent years they’ve become mainstream.

Here are some of my favorite podcasts.

### Fizzle

Fizzle is a community but also a podcast. I became part of the community after my wife kept recommending their podcast.

They talk about business, indie entrepreneurs, products, services and a bunch of things that are super interesting for entrepreneurs and wantrepreneurs.

You should check it out if you’re one of those.

### Planet Money

This is a great show by NPR. They talk about a wide variety of topics related to money (of course!)

I really like their episodes because they are short and sweet. Sometimes too short, but still super interesting!

### NPR Politics

Without even noticing I became hooked to the weekly updates about the democratic and republican primaries.

I can’t stop listening to the episodes about the race for the nominations. If you’re interested in politics in the US, you will love this show!

### Note to Self

This is a great podcast about life and technology. It goes deep into finding out how technology is changing our lives.

These are some of my favorites. I’ll share the rest some other day.

I’m also open to new recommendations. So, if you have any, let me know!
