I like to speak about things that I'm passionate about:

- Open Source
- Code Quality
- Ruby & Ruby on Rails

I've spoken at a few conferences in different countries (Argentina; Uruguay;
Chile; Australia; and USA) in both Spanish and English.

## Stuck in the Tar Pit (Sin City Ruby, 2024)

Nobody wants to inherit a project that reeks but here we are: Stuck in the tar pit. How can we get out? Could we have avoided it in the first place? In this talk you will learn how to use a few great Ruby gems that will guide you out of that sticky tar you are in. This version includes new resources, including a paper from Google called "Defining, Measuring, and Managing Technical Debt". (This talk was not recorded.)

## Here Be Dragons: The Hidden Gems of Tech Debt (RubyConf Mini, 2022)

How do you find the most unmaintainable code in your codebase? What will you prioritize in your next technical debt spike, and why? In this talk you will learn how you can use RubyCritic, SimpleCov, Flog, Reek, and Skunk to slay dragons in your next refactoring adventure. Find out how the relationship between churn, complexity, and code coverage can give you a common language to talk about code quality:

## Upgrade Rails 101: The Roadmap to Smooth Upgrades (Online Workshop, 2021)

Upgrading Rails is easy, right? Sure, as long as you are upgrading your patch version. A Rails upgrade for a big application is not a trivial project: it took GitHub a year and a half to upgrade from Rails 3.2 to 5.2. While upgrades have become easier with every new Rails version, your application has only become more complicated with every new dependency added to it. Running bundle update is not enough. In this workshop you will learn a proven Rails upgrade process for major and minor version changes of Rails. You will leave this workshop with a roadmap to upgrade your Rails application.

## RubyMem: The Leaky Gems Database for Bundler (RubyKaigi Takeout, 2020)

Out of memory errors are quite tricky. Our first reaction is always the same: "It can't be my code, it must be one of my dependencies!" What if you could quickly check that with bundler? In this talk you will learn about memory leaks, out of memory errors, and leaky dependencies. You will learn how to use bundler-leak, a community-driven, open source tool that will make your life easier when debugging memory leaks:

## Escaping The Tar Pit (RubyConf AU, 2020)

In this talk you will learn how to use a few great Ruby gems that will guide you out of technical debt. I introduce the StinkScore metric, which combines code smells, complexity, and code coverage to help you identify the most problematic areas of your codebase. Thanks to [FastRuby.io](https://www.fastruby.io) for sponsoring my trip to Melbourne:

## Escaping The Tar Pit (RubyConf, 2019)

This is version 2.1 of the talk I presented at SolidusConf. There are a few
improvements to `skunk` which made it to this talk. The StinkScore formula
changed to more accurately represent improvements to your code base:

## Escaping The Tar Pit (SolidusConf, 2019)

In this talk I explain how to avoid getting stuck in the tar pit and, if you
are in it, how to gradually get out of it. This is the first time I spoke about
a new library to judge maintainability based on code quality and code coverage:

## Upgrade Rails 101: The Roadmap to Smooth Upgrades (Southeast Ruby, 2019)

This is version 2.1 of the workshop I conducted at RailsConf. In this iteration
I decide to use Docker to make it easier to get things set up. This proved to
be a great decision as it decreased setup issues to 0%. Setting things up took
about 10 minutes, but it was smooth sailing after that.

## Upgrade Rails 101: The Roadmap to Smooth Upgrades (RailsConf, 2019)

In this workshop I present a few simple steps to upgrade your Rails application.
Unfortunately there is no recording of this workshop, but you can find a
companion page over here: [https://www.fastruby.io/upgrade](https://www.fastruby.io/upgrade)

## Open Source: When Nights & Weekends Are Not Enough (Southeast Ruby, 2017)

In this talk I share my experience as an open source contributor and maintainer
after becoming a father. I share a few great ways to bake in open source
contributions in your day-to-day:

## Introducción a Lean Startup (RobinTech, 2014)

In this talk I explain a few concepts about Lean Startup after a couple of years
running my startup ([Ombu Shop](https://www.ombushop.com)). This talk was in
Spanish.

## Don't Feed The Zombies! (RubyConf Uruguay, 2013)

In this talk I explain a few good ways to inherit and maintain "zombie projects".
When you inherit a legacy project, how can you improve the status quo of the
project? How can you gradually pay off tech debt to turn a zombie into an
easy-to-maintain project?

## The Lean Startup Hacker (RubyConf Argentina, 2012)

In this talk I explain a few concepts about Lean Startup as applied in my first
startup: [Ombu Shop, Tu Tienda Online](https://www.ombushop.com). This talk was
in Spanish.
