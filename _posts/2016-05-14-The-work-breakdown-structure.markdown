Next time you need to tackle a big project, break it down into smaller projects. If the sub-projects are still too big, break them down into sub-sections. Then break those down into action items. You get the idea.

This technique has been around for ages, though in college it was reintroduced to me as the [Work Breakdown Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure).

Before you start working on a huge project, you should have a list of prioritized items in your **TODO** list. Priorities will be defined by your requirements and limitations.

If you have a hard delivery date, you need to think about the duration of each part. If you only have 3 months and one of the parts will take 2 months due to [bureaucracy](https://medium.com/@etagwerker/a-great-source-of-startup-ideas-6d34ac3d88bd#.ogl6qrzgb) (in life this will always happen) you should start with that on day 1.

Sometimes we face projects that seem **impossible** to be accomplished on time. This is what you need to know: They are **not impossible**. You just need to apply the **WBS** before you start.
