I hate bureaucracy. I believe **we all hate bureaucracy**. I probably hate it even more than you, because I am an Information Systems Engineer.

I’ve been taught to look at systems and think of ways to improve them. And let me tell you, **there is so much that can be improved in terms of bureaucracy**.

Every time I’m at the bank, I think about the different ways that they could improve the **customer experience**.

Every time I’m at the [AFIP](http://afip.gov.ar/) (the Argentine [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/)), I think about the many ways that they could **simplify** their processes to get more people to pay their taxes.

I believe that the best systems provide **good experiences**, which encourage and guide the people who use them.

If you are looking for your **next startup idea**, _scratch your own itch_. Think about all the bureaucratic processes that you have to go through every month.

How could you improve them? Could you build a [productized service](https://casjam.com/why-productized-service/) around a **shitty government process**? Sure!

What would it take for you to make my life a little easier? How could you **save people time** by doing the annoying tasks that we do every month?

I would be happy to pay up to **$50** for _every hour you help me save_. I bet there are a lot of people in the same position.

You can count on **bureaucracies** moving slow (usually **very very slow**) on their process upgrades, which will only reduce the risk of your business failing.

Please **build a startup that will reduce the burden of bureaucracy** and bring it to Argentina (you will make a lot of money)
